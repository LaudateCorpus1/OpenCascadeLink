# OpenCascadeLink for the Wolfram Language

The [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) has build in support for the Finite Element Method. OpenCascadeLink is a package that provides computational geometry functionality to generate 3D boundary meshes for the finite element method. OpenCascadeLink ships with version 12.1 and later versions of Wolfram Language deployments for the desktop, including [Wolfram Desktop](https://www.wolfram.com/desktop/) and [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/).
